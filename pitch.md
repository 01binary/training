Recently I passed Differential Calculus at Oregon State University. This is the second time I've taken this class. Why did I take this class twice, you ask?

Well, it wasn't because I loved it. Twenty years ago as a college freshman, I failed Calculus, and this defeat has set the tone for the rest of my career. I aspired to build bi-pedal and quadrupedal mobile robots. Instead I ended up grinding for half a decade as a Graphic Designer and Illustrator.

Since I never gave up writing software, I eventually found my way back into the field by substituting real-world experience for academic achievement. But the only jobs I could get involved creating digital products, which left me feeling unfulfilled.

Electrical and mechanical engineering knowledge I needed was still closely guarded. Online tutorials on the topics I was interested in were frustratingly inaccessible, because the goal of those writing them was to advertise their skills rather than educate someone.

Over the years I bought several Calculus textbooks but could not understand any of them. When I finally reached a point in building my own robot where I would have to stop the project if I didn't immediately acquire math skills, I got Calculus Workbook by Chris McMullen and Differential Equations in 24 hours bu Scott Imhoff. I finished both books and followed them up with Differential Calculus online course at OSU, passing it with an A.

Now, I am here to tell you that there is no reason why you should study arcane differentiation and integration rules and refactor large equations by hand. I believe it's possible to deeply understand these concepts while using modern tools like Octave and Matlab to learn exactly the same amount of material in 2-3 weeks that traditional schools spread over 11 weeks of online learning.

Because of my own life-long struggle with math, I believe I could help others achieve their goals with empathy, patience, and understanding.

So, let's learn math for robotics together.
