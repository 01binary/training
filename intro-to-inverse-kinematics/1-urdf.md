Welcome to our course! We’re going to start by exploring the Universal Robot Description Format, or URDF. This will allow us to control real robots right away, while also helping us visualize how inverse kinematics works. Let’s get started on this exciting journey together!

We've now finished assembling the two robot arms in Blender. This hands-on experience has given you a clear understanding of how the URDF comes together and how the parts connect. Great job following along—you're one step closer to controlling real robots!
