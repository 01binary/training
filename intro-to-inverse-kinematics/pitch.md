If you’ve ever wanted to understand how robots grasp and manipulate objects, then this is the course for you.

We’ll explore the three major types of inverse kinematics solvers — numerical, analytical, and geometric — and walk through building each one from scratch.

Whether you’re tinkering with robots at home, developing professional automation solutions, or just fascinated by the theory behind how things work, this course is designed to be hands-on, practical, and approachable - all with high-school level math skills.

We’ll start with the basics — describing robots using URDF, modeling joints with transformation matrices, and visualizing kinematic chains.

Then we'll investigate the solvers themselves: from Gradient Descent and Jacobians, to geometric tricks using inverse trigonometric functions and the Law of Cosines.

You’ll learn how to plug your custom solvers into MoveIt so your robot can handle real-world tasks like Pick and Place, all while avoiding collisions and navigating complex environments.
