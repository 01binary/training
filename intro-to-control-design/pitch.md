Hello and welcome to "Introduction to Control Design"! In this course, you'll discover how to bring your robots to life with smoothness, precision, and reliability.

Whether you're an engineer venturing into the world of robotics, a web developer exploring embedded systems, or a student eager to gain hands-on experience for the first time, this course will serve as an excellent foundation for your journey.

{Footage of code in C++ and Python, motors reacting to PID tuning in real time}

We will go beyond theory. You'll engage in writing PID controllers in both C++ and Python, upload them to real hardware, and even construct your own motor tuning rig to capture data and optimize performance.

You'll gain a deep understanding of each PID term—Proportional, Integral, and Derivative—and learn how to tackle challenges like overshoot, windup, and oscillations.

We'll guide you through the process of tuning by hand, modeling your motor with system identification, and ensuring you achieve reliable control, even when dynamics become complex.

Control design is what transforms motors into muscles, and PID control is where it all begins. By the end of this course, you won’t just understand the concepts—you’ll truly own them.

Get ready to bridge the gap between code and mechanics, build smarter robots, and step confidently into the exciting world of control systems. We can't wait to see you in class!
